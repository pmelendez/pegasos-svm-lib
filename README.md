This is a naive implementation of the algorithm descripted in the paper "Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM" http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~shai/papers/ShalevSiSr07.pdf.

A more detailed explanation is available on the longer version http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~nati/Publications/PegasosMPB.pdf
